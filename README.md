# ab-testing-dotnet-sample
A sample application showcasing how A/B testing with ConfigCat's Feature Flags and Amplitude can be done.

This app uses ConfigCat's feature flags and user segmentation system to change the color of the add-to-cart button. The feature flag toggle (ON/OFF) determines how the app behaves, and this change in color can influence the user clickthrough rate, which is measured by Amplitude.
